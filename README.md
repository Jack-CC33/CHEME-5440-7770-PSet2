# CHEME-5440-7770-PSet2
This repository holds my code for Problem Set 2. The goal of this project was to model the steady-state mRNA of a given gene in a cell-free system subject to different concentrations of an inducer.  The code was completed based on a framework from https://github.com/varnerlab/CHEME-5440-7770-PS2-S21 courtesy of the Varner Lab at Cornell University.
